# Trajectories-in-the-Universe
This is a group project in which we worked on the differential equation. We used the Raunge-Kutta (RK4) method to solve the differential equation and find the trajectory of planets and suns. We write a detailed report on one, two and three body problems and simulate trajectories of that systems.
